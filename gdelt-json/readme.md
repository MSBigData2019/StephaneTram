This folder contains the files we used to populate our mongo database.

The file json-generator.ipynb is the central notebooked used to manipulate the files from gdelt and generate scripts to run on the aws machines.
The top part is used to generate file lists from the master files taken on the gdelt website. the lists contain the url of the files for a period of ten days.

the bottom part is used to generate bash scripts to launch successively the processing of each file list.

The core of the processing of csv file from the gdelt website is in the file generate-json.py
Basically it creates a concatenated dataframe from a list of csv files et build a json file from it. The json files are then stored in an amazon s3 bucket.

The json files are then copied locally to one of the mongo machines and uploaded through a mongo import (this is done using bash scripts generated by the python notebook as well)

Then the mongoio.ipynb notebook was used to generate the mongoupdate.py script which is used to update the mongo documents directly in the database using json formatted mentions.
